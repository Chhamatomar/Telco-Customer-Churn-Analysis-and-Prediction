# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue a service so that businesses can take proactive retention measures

## Problem Statement
Customer retention plays a crucial role in business growth. Losing existing customers leads to increased acquisition costs.  
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on historical customer data.

## About Dataset
The dataset contains historical customer information, including:
- Demographic details
- Service usage information
- Account and billing data

- **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes / No)

- ## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning 
- Google Colab

- ## Project Workflow
1. Data Understanding  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
4. Feature Encoding and Scaling  
5. Model Training  
6. Model Evaluation

7. ## Machine Learning Models
- Support Vector Machine  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier

- ## Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision  
- Recall

- These metrics are used to assess the performance of the churn prediction model.

- ## Results
The model is able to predict customer churn with reliable performance and helps identify customers who are at high risk of leaving the service.

- ## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and serves as a foundation for deployment-based ML applications.
